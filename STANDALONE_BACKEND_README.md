# Standalone Backend for ByteStream Desktop

## What's Been Created

I've successfully created a standalone executable for the Python backend (`bytestream-backend`) that doesn't require Python to be installed on the end user's machine.

### Files Created:
- `bytestream-backend` - Standalone executable (13MB) containing all Python dependencies
- `run-packaged-app.sh` - Script to test the packaged app

### How It Works:

1. The standalone executable bundles Python 3.11 and all required packages (Flask, BeautifulSoup4, etc.)
2. When ByteStream starts, it automatically launches the backend server on port 8080
3. The backend is automatically stopped when you quit ByteStream

### Running the App:

#### Option 1: From Terminal
```bash
./run-packaged-app.sh
```

#### Option 2: Double-click the App
Navigate to `dist/ByteStream-darwin-x64/` and double-click `ByteStream.app`

### Distribution:

To distribute the app to users:
1. The entire `ByteStream.app` bundle in `dist/ByteStream-darwin-x64/` 
2. No Python installation required
3. No additional dependencies needed

### Testing the Backend Separately:

You can test the standalone backend by itself:
```bash
./bytestream-backend
```

This will start the server on http://localhost:8080

### Notes:
- The backend executable is included in the app bundle at `ByteStream.app/Contents/Resources/bytestream-backend`
- The app will check for the backend in multiple locations to support both development and production environments
- If you see any macOS security warnings, you may need to allow the app in System Preferences > Security & Privacy
